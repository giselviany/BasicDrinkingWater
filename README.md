# BasicDrinkingWater
Developed a time series forecasting model to predict the growth rate of Indonesians using at least basic drinking water services, a critical measure of national health and development.  
●	Applied various methods including Naïve, Double Moving Average (DMA), Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), Time Series Regression, ARIMA and Neural Networks to identify the most accurate forecasting approach.  
●	Determined that the Neural Network model provided the best results, minimizing error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and predicting 100% access by 2032.  
●	Highlighted the need for strategic interventions to accelerate access to clean drinking water across all regions.  
●	Utilized R and Excel for data analysis, model development, and forecast evaluation.
